### QUADRATIC EQUATION SOLVER

This repository contains files and folder for project that  aims to develop and deploy a scalable web application that solves quadratic equations, incorporating modern DevOps practices and cloud infrastructure automation. 
The application will provide users with a simple interface to input coefficients (a, b, c) of a quadratic equation (axÂ² + bx + c = 0) and receive calculated roots in real-time.

The technical implementation leverages containerization through Docker for consistent deployment environments, Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using both Terraform and AWS CloudFormation for cloud resource management, and Bash scripting for automation and operational tasks. 
This multi-tool approach demonstrates the integration of various DevOps technologies while solving a practical mathematical problem.
